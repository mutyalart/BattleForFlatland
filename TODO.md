# To implement

- show animation with damage and heals <- done, although the implementation, as the reste of the game gui, is awful
- implement obstacles and path finding for AIs
- allow to chose colour <- done but need to improve interface
- allow to customize keys
- allow to go fullscreen
- mini health bar at entities positions
- beginning of the game when players are ready inside the game itself: button to launch the boss, or boss aggro zone
- players should spawn in the game at boss-dependent defined positions
- integrate with boopickle
